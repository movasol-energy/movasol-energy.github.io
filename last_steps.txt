Use media queries in your CSS to ensure the site looks good on different devices.
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  nav ul {
    text-align: center;
  }
  
  nav ul li {
    display: block;
    margin: 10px 0;
  }
}

Check the website on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) to ensure consistency.

If you plan to add a mobile menu, build out the JavaScript functionality and corresponding HTML elements (e.g., a hamburger icon with the ID menu-toggle).

Once the basic version is up, review it with your boss or colleagues to get feedback and identify improvements.

Continuously update your content, design, and code based on feedback and testing.
